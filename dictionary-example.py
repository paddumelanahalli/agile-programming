# Python Practice 10

#A dictionary is another example of a data structure, and, like a list,
#it is one of the most commonly used data structures in programming.
#A dictionary is used to map or associate things you want to store to keys you need to get them
# create a mapping of state to abbreviation

states = {
    'Oregon': 'OR',
    'Florida': 'FL',
    'California': 'CA',
    'New York': 'NY',
    'Michigan': 'MI'
}

# create a basic set of states and some cities in them
cities = {
    'CA': 'San Francisco',
    'MI': 'Detroit',
    'FL': 'Jacksonville'
}

# add some more cities
cities['NY'] = 'New York'
cities['OR'] = 'Portland'

# print out some cities
print('-' * 10)
print("NY State has: ", cities['NY'])
print("OR State has: ", cities['OR'])

# print some states
print('-' * 10)
print("Michigan's abbreviation is: ", states['Michigan'])
print("Florida's abbreviation is: ", states['Florida'])

# do it by using the state then cities dict
print('-' * 10)
print("Michigan has: ", cities[states['Michigan']])
print("Florida has: ", cities[states['Florida']])

# print every state abbreviation
print('-' * 10)
for state, abbrev in list(states.items()):
    print(f"{state} is abbreviated {abbrev}")

# print every city in state
print('-' * 10)
for abbrev, city in list(cities.items()):
    print(f"{abbrev} has the city {city}")

# now do both at the same time
print('-' * 10)
for state, abbrev in list(states.items()):
    print(f"{state} state is abbreviated {abbrev}")
    print(f"and has city {cities[abbrev]}")

print('-' * 10)
# safely get a abbreviation by state that might not be there
state = states.get('Texas')

if not state:
    print("Sorry, no Texas.")

# get a city with a default value
city = cities.get('TX', 'Does Not Exist')
print(f"The city for the state 'TX' is: {city}")

#1. Do this same kind of mapping with cities and states/regions in your country or some other country.
#2. Find the Python documentation for dictionaries and try to do even more things to them.
#3.. Find out what you can’t do with dictionaries. A big one is that they do not have order, so try playing with that.
