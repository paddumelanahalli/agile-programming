# +: plus

# *: asterisk
# %: mod
# <: less-than

# <=: less-than-equal
# >=: greater-than-equal
# Notice how the operations are missing? After you type in the code for this exercise, go back and figure out what each of these does and complete the table.
# For example,+does addition.

print("I will now count my chickens:")
print("Hens", 25 + 30 / 6)
print("Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4)
print("Now I will count the eggs:")
print(3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6)
print("Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 -7?")
print(3 + 2 < 5 - 7)
print("What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2)
print("What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7)
print("Oh, that's why it's False.")
print("How about some more.")
print("Is it greater?", 5 > -2)
print("Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2)
print("Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2)

# STUDY DRILLS
# Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.
# Find something you need to calculate and write a new.py file that does it.
# Rewrite to use floating point numbers so it’s more accurate. 20.0 is floating point
# How does % work? Another way to say it is, “X divided by Y with J remaining.”
# For example, “100 divided by 16 with 4 remaining.” The result of % is the J part, or the remaining part.
